<p> In this repository you will find just the bare bones of what we were working on because most of my production environment was done in my personal repo which I made public so you should be able to see at the following link. Otherwise there are two important documents contained herein, Project 4's README-CI.md and Project 5's README-CD.md, -CI being over continuous integration and -CD being over continuous deployment. On my personal repo you will find the source code for my Java CRUD app, the github workflows folder, and the deployment folder which contains my deploy.sh, hooks.json and webhook.service files. I apologize that my work beomces incomplete towards the end; I simply ran out of time to finish the project completely.</p>
